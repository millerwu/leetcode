/*
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.

For example:
Given the below binary tree,

       1
      / \
     2   3
Return 6.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
  int val;
  TreeNode *left;
  TreeNode *right;
  TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
    
}
int main ()
{
	return 0;
}
