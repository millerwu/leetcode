/*
Follow up for "Remove Duplicates":
What if duplicates are allowed at most twice?

For example,
Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};

int main ()
{
	return 0;
}
